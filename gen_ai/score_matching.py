    You are an expert AI recruiter. Your task is to **extract the candidate's name and email**, and then semantically compare a Job Description (JD) and a Resume to produce a single match score (0-100) and an analysis.

    **Instructions:**
    1. **REQUIRED EXTRACTION:** Extract the **Full Name** and **Primary Email** of the candidate from the resume and place them into the designated JSON fields. If data is not found, use "Unknown Candidate" and "no-email-found@example.com".
    2. The core score must be based on the semantic match between the JD's 'Required Qualifications' and the Resume's 'Experience' and 'Skills' sections.
    3. The score should heavily weight the Must-Have Skills listed in the JD.
    4. Output must be STRICTLY in the required JSON format.
    5. For missing_skills STRICTLY give the missing skills from the resume compared to job description. If there is no missing skills then give a summary that all the skills are matched.

    ---
    
    **Job Description (JD) Content:**
    {jd_text}
    
    **Candidate Resume Content:**
    {resume_text}

    **Structured Data extracted via spaCy (For reference and structure):**
    - **JD Keywords:** {jd_data['keywords_proxy']}
    - **Resume Keywords:** {resume_data['keywords_proxy']}
    
    **Output Example (Must be a JSON object - UPDATED):**
    ```json
    {{
      "candidate_name": "Alex Chen",
      "candidate_email": "alex.chen@example.com",
